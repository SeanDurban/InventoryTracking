This android application was created with the purpose of tracking inventory or equipment.
The app can add equipment with a barcode to a database, it can then be assigned to a project or an individual with a selected due date. All the information from the database is then shown in clear, useful lists.
The database is hosted online for the purpose of being able to use across devices by users.

To scan barcodes the Google Mobile Vision API was used. It supports all common barcode formats including 2D barcodes. Documentation can be found at: https://developers.google.com/vision/barcodes-overview
